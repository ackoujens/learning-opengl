# 3D Graphics Math

## Vectors
**Vertex** is a main input in OpenGL -> has a number of attributes (position in *xyz coordinate space*)

**xyz triplet** (can be represented by a vector) -> represent a direction and magnitude

**Go positive one unit:**
- x-axis (1, 0, 0)
- y-axis (0, 1, 0)
- z-axis (0, 0, 1)

A **vector** is also **how we point** where we are going (direction):
- which way is de camera pointing
- what way do we need to move

A point in space is both a vertex and a vector

The **length** of a vector (magnitude):
- x-axis (1, 0, 0) -> the length of the vector is one (*unit vector*)

If a vector is *not a unit vector* we want to *scale* it to make one (normalization)
Normalizing a vector scales it's length to one = normalized

**Unit vectors** are important when we only want to *show direction* and not a magnitude.
Vector lengths of 1 are simpler to use in *math equations*.

**Magnitude** can be useful to note *how far* we want something to move.

## Making classes to represent vectors and matrices
**3 component vectors** (x, y, z)
```c++
vec3(-0.5f, 1.0f, -0.2f);
```

**4 component vectors** (x, y, z, w)

w component is added to make the vector *homogeneous* -> typically set to 1.0
x, y, z values might later be divided by w (when in 1.0 leaves x, y, z alone)
```c++
vec4(-0.5f, 1.0f, -0.2f, 1.0f);
```

**The w component**

Vertex position mostly done with a *vec3*. To transform *matrices* we need a *vec4*.

To transform a 3d vertex, you must multiply it by a **4 x 4** transformation matrix.

## Common vector operations
**Operations on vectors**: addition, subtraction, unary negation, ...
These operators perform a *per-component* calculations -> result in a vector of the same size as the input. Overriding the operations provide such functionalities.
```c++
vec3 a (1.0f, 2.0f, 3.0f);
vec3 b (4.0f, 5.0f, 6.0f);
vec3 c;

c = a + b;
c = a - b;
c += b;
c = -c;
```

## Dot product
Vectors can be added, subtracted, scaled by adding, subtracting, scaling their individual XYZ components.

Dot product can only be applied to 2 vectors. (aka inner product)

Dot product between 2 vec3's result in scalar (just one value) = cosine of the angle between 2 vectors scaled by the product of their lengths.

If the 2 vectors are of unit length the value returned falls between -1.0 and 1.0 and is equal to the cosine of the angle between them.

To get the actual angle between the vectors you need the inverse cosine (arc-cosine) of this value.

Dot product used extensively during lightning calculations. Taken between surface normal vector and vector pointing towards the light source. (diffuse light calculations)

Dot product of 2 vectors v1 and v2:
`v1 x v2 = v1.x X v2.x + v1.y X v2.y + v1.z X v2.z`

```c++
vec3 a(...);
vec3 b(...);

float c = a.dot(b);
float d = dot(a, b);
```

Dot product between these result in -1.0 -> 1.0 = cosine of the angle between them.
This method returns the result in radians.
`float angle(const vec3& u, const vec3& v);`

## Cross Product
Mathematical operation between 2 vectors.
Cross product AKA vector product.

Cross product between 2 vectors = a third vector that is perpendicular to the plane in which the first 2 vectors lie.

Cross product between v1 and v2.
`v1 X v2 = ||v1|| ||v2|| sin(O)n`
n = the unit vector that is perpendicular to both v1 and v2.
-> when you normalize the result of cross product = normal to a plane

Cross product of 2 3d vectors v1 and v2:
```
[v3.x] = [v1.y . v2.z - v1.z . v2.y]
[v3.y] = [v1.z . v2.x - v1.x . v2.z]
[v3.z] = [v1.x . v2.y - v1.y . v2.x]
```

```
vec3 a(...);
vec3 b(...);

vec3 c = a.cross(b);
vec3 d = cross(a, b);
```

Order of the vectors is important!
